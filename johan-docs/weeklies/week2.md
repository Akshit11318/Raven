# 21/1 - 27/1
Progress
1. Scraped MOQT factory and provide MOQT object
2. Came up with solution for lamda capture issue, callback API provides a context pointor, 
    we build closure of objects we need inside this context pointor. 
    Need to try this out for more situations and check if it works 
TODO:
1. Point 2
